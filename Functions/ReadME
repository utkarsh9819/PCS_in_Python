This folder cantains two executable python code files (.ipynb as well as .py) required to implement a parallel constraint satisfaction model of decision making.
All the functions are enlisted in the code file itself. The user has to implement the result() function to get the model running 
and obtain the desired results.

The functions along with their role can be understood as:

matrix_manipulation: Works on the dataset and transforms it into an interconnection matrix which can be computed upon using the PCS model.​
​
pcs_convergence_mccand_r: Determines whether a network has converged by examining energy changes across iterations. Convergence is achieved when energy changes remain below a threshold for a sufficient number of consecutive iterations.​
​
pcs_iterate: Calculates a new state given an interconnection matrix and previous state.​
​
pcs_energy: Calculates the energy present in the model given current state.​
​
pcs_reset:  Resets specified nodes to their fixed activation values.​
​
pcs_run: Simulates the run of a PCS model.​
​
pcs_run_from_interconnections: Simulates PCS model using only interconnection matrix with default parameters.​
​
results: Passes the dataset to be transformed and then be run through the PCS model. Finds the results and plots them.
